# Here is my Markdown file

I have created this file to document my work with regards to assignment 5. This assignment is proving to be quite interesting and I am hoping that I can resolve my issues with it as creating a working function is indeed one of the **most** rewarding feelings. At the moment of writing this, I am currently struggling with identifying *transactions[x]* as I am hoping that this can be something that I can use within my function to shorten the written code using the += function for x. We shall see.>

Quick update : 
1. I have realized that rather than using +=, I gain far more by using a for loop.
2. My issue of identifying *transactions* was an issue of a missing **c** within and was infact a simple fix.
3. With both of the previous updates instituted, my new code in file *dry_code* is working as intended. Thank goodness for that.

Here is a quick link to the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) that has been instrumental in learning how to create this .md file.

Im really hoping that this is the correct formatting and that I am all set now!
