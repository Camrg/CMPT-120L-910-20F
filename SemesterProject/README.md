This webpage is a basic site with 4 pages featured. Within, each can navigate back to the home page, as well as on to various other pages. There are pages for home, about, contact, and hobbies. When a page is seached that does not exist, the user will be sent to a 404 page that contains a link to return to the home page. All code should be neatly organized and simply laid out between the templates and a single .py file. Additionally there is logging that produces a message server side to give notice of what pages are being accessed. I hope you enjoy! Thanks for a great semester and all your help and patience!
